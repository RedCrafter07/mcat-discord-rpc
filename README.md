# mcat-discord-rpc
A Discord RPC App for the Monstercat Player

## But why?
Well, I love the Spotify RPC for Discord, but I also love the Monstercat Player. But there was something missing... You probably guessed it, I wanted a Discord RPC for it. That's why I developed this application :)

## How to use
1. Create or login with your [Monstercat Account](https://monstercat.com) and go to the Monstercat Player. 
2. Open your Discord Client
3. Download and open this application (Go to releases on the right)
4. Go to the player settings
5. Copy your widget URL and paste it into the application prompt (a textbox should appear in the center of the application, if you haven't already entered it)
6. Press Enter - That's it! The RPC should start automatically.
7. You can close the window opened and it will continue to run in your system tray. To shutdown, right click on the tray icon and select "Quit".
8. The application autosaves your widget URL. A reset method will be added soon.
9. Enjoy! And if you do, consider starring this Repository. Thanks!
